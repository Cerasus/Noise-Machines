# Noise-Machines
Synth DIY with a focus on noise generators and other sound gadgets aimed at the production of harsh noise music.

I make my cicuits to be electrically compatible (to the best of my limited knowledge) with the Eurorack format, although I don't use it myself.

I make modules in a variant of the Kosmos format created by Sam Battle (aka Look Mum No Computer). See Horrible Kosmos Format doc for my specs (not done yet).
